### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm **Kanyapat M**, a CS student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.  I thrive on solving problems, both in code and outside the box. When I'm not coding, I love exploring new places, getting lost in a good book, and cuddling with my adorable companions🐱🐶.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning locker and ML.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a DM or [email](mailto:kanyapat.mekvi.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) if you want to chat about tech, cats, or anything in between!
